	\section{Summary}
The logic gates are abstract representations of real electronic circuits
In computers, Logic gates are built using transistors combined with other electrical components like resistors and diodes. 
These electrical components are wired together in order to transform a particular input to give a desired output
Using different combination of logic gates, complex operations can be performed. 
With the Universal logic gates - NAND and NOR, any other gate can be built
There is no limit to the number of gates that can be arranged together in a single device.  
However, in practice, there is a limit to the number of gates that can be packed into a given physical space. 
Arrays of logic gates are found in digital integrated circuits.
