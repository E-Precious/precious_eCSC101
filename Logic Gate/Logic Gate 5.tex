	\section{Logic Gate}
	Now think of a logic gate like a light switch, it is either in an ON or OFF position. Similarly, the input output terminals are always in one of two binary positions false(0) and true(1). Each gate has its own logic or set of rules that determines how it acts based on multiple inputs outlined in a truth table.
