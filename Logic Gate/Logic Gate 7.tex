	\section{Logic Gate}
A gate is a basic electronic circuit which operates on one or more signals to produce an output signal. 
Logic gates are digital circuits constructed from diodes, transistors, and resistors connected in such a way that the circuit output is the result of a basic logic operation (OR, AND, NOT) performed on the inputs.
