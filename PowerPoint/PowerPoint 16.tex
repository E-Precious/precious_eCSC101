	\section{Introduction}
	The C sharp programming Language is ranked 4th according to the PYPL index. Although the program has been said to have fallen in its popularity mostly due to its slow growth rate as compared to Python, C++ and C
	\subsection{History and Founder}
	C sharp programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg in 2000 under the Microsoft organization.Anders Hejlsberg is a Danish programmer and systems architect born on the 2nd of December 1960. He wrote programs for the Nascom Microcomputer. He also developed a Pascal compiler which he later re-wrote for CP/M and DOS and it was later integrated into an IDE which was known as the Turbo Pascal system'He has worked with Borland, PolyData and is currently working with Microsoft
	\paragraph{Additional Information}C sharp is a general purpose, open-source programming language. It was designed with the intent of being simple and object-oriented suitable for writing programs with both hosted and embedded systems.C sharp, although designed in 2000 was approved by international standards in 2002. The syntax style is said to be largely very similar to that of Java, c and C++. It is very identical to Java and debates have arisen as to if it were simply a copy of Java.The inspiration for the name C sharp was as expected gotten from the musical note of the same name, and just as the musical c sharp signifies  that it is a pitch higher than c. The C sharp programming language is intended to be an increment of the C++. It was originally intended to be called COOL= C-Like Object Oriented Language but was changed for trademark reasons
